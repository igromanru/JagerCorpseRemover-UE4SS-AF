[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
Simple mod that removes Jager's corps in cafeteria each time you load into the game. 
When you're the host, the mod should remove the corpse for all players. When you're on someone elseâ€™s server, it will make the corpse invisible to you.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
Current UE4SS version works well with the game, but it has of a problem that causes the game to crash when you exit it.
It has nothing to do with the mod and it has no negative impact on the game or your save file, it's just a bit annoying.
And you might want to delete crash dump ([b].dmp[/b]) files from time to time from your game directory.
