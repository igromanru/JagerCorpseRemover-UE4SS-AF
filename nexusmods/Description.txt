[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
Simple mod that removes Jager's corpse in the cafeteria each time you load into the game. 
When you're the host, the mod should remove the corpse for all players. When you're on someone elseâ€™s server, it will make the corpse invisible to you.
Since v1.1.0 it now removes the corpse in the cafeteria's kitchen as well. But Apron and Chef's Hat spawn is still in tact, also the blood is still there.
Since v1.2.0: Removes Hydroplant Apartments corpses. Can now be configurated in the [i]main.lua[/i]. (See Mod Configuration section below)

[size=3]Unreal Engine Scripting System aka. [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS]RE-UE4SS[/url][/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest version of RE-UE4SS from it's [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases]Release[/url] section. You need the [b]UE4SS_v{version number}.zip [/b] (e.g.  UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip)
2. Unzip the content of the zip archive into the following location: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]It should be at the location of the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b] ![/size]
[size=2]For Steam users it might be something like this: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
[size=2]Make sure you don't create a new folder while extracting! If you do just move the content to the destination after.[/size]
3. Now use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab to download the mod as a zip file as well.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]JagerCorpseRemover[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\[/i]
[size=2]Make sure you don't create a new folder while extracting! If you do just move the content to the destination after.[/size]
[size=2]Whole mod path should be like this: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\JagerCorpseRemover\[/i][/size]
[size=2]Steam example: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\JagerCorpseRemover\[/i][/size]
5. Verify that you have installed the mod correctly.
The mod directory should contain a [b]Scripts[/b] folder and an [b]enabled.txt[/b] file.
[size=2][i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\JagerCorpseRemover\Scripts\[/i]
[i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\JagerCorpseRemover\enabled.txt[/i][/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Mod Configuration[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]All the configurations are happening in the [b]main.lua[/b][/size]
1. Navigate into mod's directory->scripts to find the [b]main.lua[/b] file.
[size=2]It should be under: (game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\JagerCorpseRemover\Scripts\[/size]
2. Open the [b]main.lua[/b] with Notepad or any other text editor.
3. Under the [b]Settings[/b] section in the [i]main.lua[/i] you will find a variable for each corpse.
    Simply change [b]true[/b] to [b]false[/b] if you want to keep a specific corpse.
4. Don't forget to save the file!

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Recommended UE4SS settings[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]I highly recommend to change these settings to improve performance and reduce crashes.[/size]
1. Navigate to the game directory where you've installed the UE4SS: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]e.g. [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
2. Open [b]UE4SS-settings.ini[/b] with any text editor.
3. Find following entries and change them as following:
[code]bUseUObjectArrayCache = false
GuiConsoleEnabled = 0
EnableDumping = 0
[/code]4. Save the UE4SS-settings.ini.
5. Navigate into the [b]Mods[/b] directory and open [b]mods.txt[/b] with a text editor
6. Disable following mods by setting the value behind ":" to 0:
[code]BPModLoaderMod : 0
BPML_GenericFunctions : 0[/code]
7. Save the file
[size=2]If you still experience performance issues, write a detailed comment what happens, your PC specs and which mods you use.[/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
Current UE4SS version works well with the game, but it has of a problem that causes the game to crash when you exit it.
It has nothing to do with the mod and it has no negative impact on the game or your save file, it's just a bit annoying.
And you might want to delete crash dump ([b].dmp[/b]) files from time to time from your game directory.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Disclaimer[/b][/size][/font]
I played to my strength and made a mod that finds and removes corpses at runtime. Ideally  it should be a ".pak" mod that removes the corpses from the game completely.
I'd be happy to retire the mod if someone would do it properly.
